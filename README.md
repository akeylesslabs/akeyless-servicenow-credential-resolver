## Akeyless ServiceNow Credential Resolver

### Overview

This project provides a ServiceNow MID external credential resolver that retrieves secrets from Akeyless and maps them to ServiceNow Discovery credential fields. The resolver class is `com.snc.discovery.CredentialResolver`.


### Prerequisites

- ServiceNow instance (Quebec+ recommended) with Discovery and External Credentials enabled.
- MID Server installed and connected to your instance.
- Network access from the MID Server host to the Akeyless Gateway (default `https://api.akeyless.io`, or your private gateway URL).
- An Akeyless Access ID and one of the supported authentication methods listed below.

### Supported Akeyless authentication methods

- `access_key`: Access ID + Access Key
- `aws_iam`: CloudID from AWS
- `azure_ad`: CloudID from Azure
- `gcp`: CloudID from GCP

For cloud-based methods, the resolver detects CloudID using the cloud environment. Ensure the MID Server is running where a CloudID can be obtained (e.g., EC2 with an instance profile, Azure VM with a managed identity, GCP VM with default credentials). For local/dev use, prefer `access_key`.

### Build the JAR

This is a Maven project. Build a versioned JAR so the filename is stable in MID:

```bash
mvn -Drevision=1.0.0 clean package
```

Artifacts:
- With `-Drevision=1.0.0`: `target/akeyless-servicenow-credential-resolver-1.0.0.jar`
- Without a revision property, Maven will produce `akeyless-servicenow-credential-resolver-null.jar`.

### Install the resolver on the MID Server

1) Upload the JAR to the MID Server via the instance UI
- Navigate: MID Server → JAR files → New
- Set a descriptive Name (e.g., `akeyless-servicenow-credential-resolver`)
- Manage Attachments → upload the built JAR from `target/`
- Submit

2) Ensure the MID downloads the JAR
- The MID will sync and place the JAR in its `agent` lib cache.
- If not picked up, restart the MID service to force a sync.

### Configure MID properties (Akeyless parameters)

Set the following MID properties on your instance (System Properties or MID Properties). Property names are case-sensitive.

- `ext.cred.akeyless.gw_url` (string): Akeyless Gateway. Default: `https://api.akeyless.io`
- `ext.cred.akeyless.access_type` (string): One of `access_key`, `aws_iam`, `azure_ad`, `gcp`. Default: `access_key`
- `ext.cred.akeyless.access_id` (string): Your Akeyless Access ID (required)
- `ext.cred.akeyless.access_key` (string): Your Akeyless Access Key (required for `access_key` only)

Optional field mapping overrides for JSON secrets (see Mapping section below):
- `ext.cred.akeyless.map.username` (default: `username`)
- `ext.cred.akeyless.map.password` (default: `password`)
- `ext.cred.akeyless.map.private_key` (default: `private_key`)
- `ext.cred.akeyless.map.passphrase` (default: `passphrase`)

Environment/system property alternatives
- The resolver also supports the following system properties or environment variables:
  - `AKEYLESS_GW_URL`
  - `AKEYLESS_ACCESS_TYPE`
  - `AKEYLESS_ACCESS_ID` (required)
  - `AKEYLESS_ACCESS_KEY` (when using `access_key`)
- As a fallback for any `ext.cred.*` property, an environment variable with the uppercased name and dots replaced by underscores is also read (e.g., `EXT_CRED_AKEYLESS_GW_URL`).
- Precedence: MID properties override environment/system variables.

### Configure a Discovery Credential to use this resolver

1) Create a new credential
- Navigate: Discovery → Credentials → New
- Choose a credential Type (e.g., Windows, SSH Password, SSH Private Key, VMware, JDBC, JMS, SNMPv3)
- Select “External credential store”
- Fully Qualified Class Name (FQCN): `com.snc.discovery.CredentialResolver`
- Credential ID: The Akeyless secret path (e.g., `/prod/app/db`) to fetch

2) Save and test
- Click “Test credential”, select a MID Server and a target if required by the type.

### What to store in Akeyless and how it’s mapped

The resolver accepts either:
- A plain string secret → mapped as a password/token
- A JSON object → fields are mapped to ServiceNow credential fields as per the credential Type

Default mapping (can be overridden via `ext.cred.akeyless.map.*`):
- Username field: `username`
- Password field: `password`
- Private key field: `private_key`
- Passphrase field: `passphrase`

Per-Type mapping summary
- Windows, Basic, SSH Password, VMware, JDBC, JMS:
  - Uses JSON fields: `username`, `password` (or your overridden names)
- SSH Private Key:
  - Uses JSON fields: `username`, `private_key`, `passphrase`
- SNMPv3:
  - Uses JSON fields: `username`, `auth_protocol`, `auth_key`, `privacy_protocol`, `privacy_key`
  - Mapped to ServiceNow fields: `username`, `auth-protocol`, `auth-key`, `privacy-protocol`, `privacy-key`
- Any other type:
  - Best-effort: `username` and `password` if present

Examples

Basic / Windows / SSH Password (JSON in Akeyless):
```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "password": "secret"
}
```

SSH Private Key:
```json
{
  "username": "ssh-user",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "passphrase": "optional"
}
```

SNMPv3:
```json
{
  "username": "snmpu",
  "auth_protocol": "SHA",
  "auth_key": "authKeyHere",
  "privacy_protocol": "AES",
  "privacy_key": "privacyKeyHere"
}
```

Custom field names via mapping overrides (example):
- Set `ext.cred.akeyless.map.username = user_name`
- Set `ext.cred.akeyless.map.password = pwd`

Then a JSON like:
```json
{
  "user_name": "alice",
  "pwd": "secret"
}
```
will map to ServiceNow `username = alice`, `password = secret`.

### CloudID notes (aws_iam / azure_ad / gcp)

- When `ext.cred.akeyless.access_type` (or `AKEYLESS_ACCESS_TYPE`) is `aws_iam`, `azure_ad`, or `gcp`, the resolver fetches a CloudID and sends it to Akeyless during auth.
- Ensure the MID Server host is running in the target cloud with the appropriate identity, or that cloud SDK environment is present to retrieve a CloudID.
- Do not set `access_key` when using CloudID-based methods.

### Troubleshooting

- HTTP 400 “Missing required parameter - timestamp” on `/auth`:
  - Usually indicates the wrong auth flow or missing parameters. Verify `access_type` is set correctly. For CloudID flows, do not set an `access_key`. For `access_key` flows, ensure both `access_id` and `access_key` are set.
- HTTP 404 from `/v2/*` endpoints:
  - The resolver automatically falls back to the non-`/v2` endpoints. If both fail, verify the gateway URL and network reachability.
- “Secret value not found for name …”:
  - Confirm the Credential ID (secret path) is correct and the Akeyless identity has permission to read it.
- Logging:
  - Resolver logs go through Commons Logging. Check the MID Server logs for entries containing “Akeyless resolver”.

### Local/dev testing (optional)

You can run unit tests locally:

```bash
mvn test
```

To quickly sanity-check end-to-end against Akeyless, set environment variables and create a Discovery credential that points to a known secret path. For cloud-based auth types, run the MID on a host with a valid cloud identity.
